The top part of the file was provided by the professor in CMSC456 at the University of Maryland. It contains a stream cipher encryption algorithm similar to RC4.
In this file I made functions EAV_choose, EAV_Attack, and decrypt to exploit the given method of encryption. These functions as well as the test and main functions
were my work. All other functions were provided by the professor.
